    and setting specific access permissions as per the request.

    **Request Body:**
    - `user_email`: The email address of the user initiating the request (e.g., `user@example.com`).
    - `team_name`: The name of the team for which the sandbox environment is being requested.
    - `requested_duration_hours`: The number of hours for which the sandbox environment is requested.
    - `request_description`: A brief description of the request, such as the purpose of the sandbox (e.g., `"POC On XYZ"`).
    - `additional_users`: A list of additional users who need access to the sandbox environment. Default is an empty list.
