I am building an API application google cloud sandbox provisioner in fastapi. I have converted it into fastmcp_fastapi as well which exposes my API as MCP tools. Now, I want to create pydantic AI agent which will take inputs from user like email id, number of hours sandbox required.

which AI model should I use in my agent to get maximum benefit out of such use case.
